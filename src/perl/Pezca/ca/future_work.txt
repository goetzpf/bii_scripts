Argonne Ideas
------------
Support new database access
Use UDP rather than TCP
Security
Large arrays
Bulk data transfer (Frame grabber images, APS BPM raw data,etc)
Simplified client interface
Wild card ca_search?
client server keys?
Provide support for process passive and for maximize severity
should ioc perform ca_search at boot time to make sure there is not conflict.?
Multi-priority - proper degradation
Redundancy - using alternate ethernet card
Seperate network interfaces (use 1 net for Data Acq./1 for ctrl)
Wide Area Network Support
Reduce Protocol Interface
Byte order problem
Reflective Memory( Does this belong here or under other IOC needs)
