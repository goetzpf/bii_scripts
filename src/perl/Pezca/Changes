0.01  Thu Jul  9 12:06:42 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18

(0.02-0.04) Sorry, no change history for these versions

0.05  Thu Mar  2 2000
      The package was cleaned up for distribution. The perl module
      platform.p now contains architecture dependent stuff.
      
0.06  Fri Mar  3 2000
      Support for solaris was added (thanks to 
      Rozelle Wright <rwright@lanl.gov>).
      
      An error in the test program test.pl was removed.

0.07  Mon Mar  6 2000
      Sources from EPICS R3.13.1 were integrated into Pezca.
      The makefile-system was re-written.
      Windows-Support has been partially added but was not tested.
      Note that ca/windows_depen.c needed to be patched:
        #ifdef _WIN32 
	  [the original content of windows_depen.c]
	#endif 
	
0.08  Fri Mar 17 2000
      Monitor functions for the reading of strings have been added. The old
      monitor functions were only usable for the reading of floating point
      numbers. All string functions have an 'S' at the end of their name.

      * Functions for reading and writing channels with more than one item
        (e.g.  Waveform-Record) have been added (GetList and PutList). 
      * The new GetList-Function
	returns a list, like the old Get function. Since GetList can
	return an arbitrary number of elements, it makes sense to return
	the error code as first, not as last element of that list.
	This is different from the old Get functions, which returned the
	error code as the 2nd element of a 2-element list.
	In order to be consistent, replacements have been written for the 
	existing Get-Functions which also return the error code as first 
	list-element. For backward-compatibility, the functions with 
	the new behaviour have got new names (e.g. GetDouble). The old Get
	Functions can still be used, but should not be used for new
	developments.
      * The new naming convention now adds the internal data-type to the 
	function name, e.g. Pezca::Put() becomes Pezca::PutDouble(). The old
	names however can still be used.
      * Further functions of ezca have been added, like ezcaGetPrecision. 
	ezcaGetStatus will not be added in this version, since it's a bit more
	complicated....
      * Perl-Prototypes have been specified for all implemented functions.

0.10  Wed May 17 2000
	An error in Pezca::AutoErrorMessageOff() was corrected.
	
0.2   Mon Dec 18 2000
	Pezca was ported to the Windows NT platform. The program was not
	thoroughly tested but Pezca::get() works. It was compiled using
	Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and perl 5.6. Perl was compiled from
	the official source, using the same c-compiler. 
	The EPICS-sources were taken from Release R3.13.1.
