Pezca 0.09, the Perl-ezca module.

license:
--------
The software license is documented in the file LICENSE. 
Note that this package contains code from the EPICS distribution
in form of c source-code. Note that these files have their own copyright
and were NOT developed at BESSY GmbH.

compiling the module:
---------------------
"perl Makefile.PL"
"make"

testing:
--------
"make test"
The test-program asks for the name of a process variable and makes a 
read-access to that variable.

installing:
-----------
"make install"

documentation:
--------------
There is a man-page in the man-directory. In the examples directory there 
are 2 examples of a perl ca-gateway (the client reads the data via a 
raw socket connection).


Support of other platforms:
---------------------------
Currently supported are HP-UX, Solaris, Linux and Windows NT.
For other platforms you have to figure out the defines that the compiler 
call needs (e.g. '-DUNIX') and apply the changes to the file platform.p.

This file uses the perl Config-Module to determine the platform. 

Bugs and Problems:
------------------
For the Windows NT version, only Pezca::GetDouble() is tested. For 
all other platforms, all functions have been tested. 

Further developments:
---------------------
Porting Pezca to other platforms aside from HP-UX,Solaris, Linux
and Windows NT.  
Implementing wrappers to ALL functions of easy channel access (ezca).
Suggestions or improvements are welcome !
