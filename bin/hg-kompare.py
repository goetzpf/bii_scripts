use external program to diff repository (or selected files)

    Show differences between revisions for the specified files, using an
    external program. The default program used is diff, with default options
    "-Npru".

    To select a different program, use the -p/--program option. The program
    will be passed the names of two directories to compare. To pass additional
    options to the program, use -o/--option. These will be passed before the
    names of the directories to compare.

    When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown between
    those revisions. If only one revision is specified then that revision is
    compared to the working directory, and, when no revisions are specified,
    the working directory files are compared to its parent.

options:

 -o --option   pass option to comparison program
 -r --rev      revision
 -c --change   change made by revision
 -I --include  include names matching the given patterns
 -X --exclude  exclude names matching the given patterns

use "hg -v help extdiff" to show global options
