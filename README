This is the BESSY-scripts bundle.

You find here modules for perl and scripts that hopefully
will make your work easier.

How to make and install
=======================

Automatic build and installation under /opt/csr is performed by executing

	./install.sh

on the command line. If you want to install to a different location, use the
command line in install.sh and change the 'prefix' and 'SHARE_DIR' parameters
to suit your needs.
