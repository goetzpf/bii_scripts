This is the BESSY-scripts bundle.

You find here modules for perl and python and a collection of scripts that
hopefully will make your work easier.

How to make and install
=======================

Installation with make
----------------------

Basically files are installed with "make install". However, there are many
options how and where you install the files. 

The variables needed by make are defined in files whose names start with
"config". By default, make reads file "config". When you set variable
"BII_CONFIG" on the command line, you may specify a different configuration
file. 

Call for a generic installation::

  INSTALL_PREFIX=[DIR] make -sj install

Call for an installation at BESSY development hosts::

  BII_CONFIG=config.acc make -sj install

Call for an installation at BESSY controlsystem hosts::

  BII_CONFIG=config.ctl make -sj install

Installation with install.sh
----------------------------

File "install.sh" is here to make installation even easier.

First you have to make install.sh executable::

  chmod u+x install.sh

Then for a generic installation call::

  ./install.sh [DIR]

At BESSY (HZB) install on our development hosts with this command::

  ./install.sh
