This is the BESSY-scripts bundle.

You find here modules for perl and scripts that hopefully
will make your work easier.

How to make and install
=======================

First make install.sh executable::

  chmod u+x install.sh

Automatic build and installation under /opt/csr is performed by executing::

  ./install.sh

on the command line. If you want to install to a different location, 
call install like this::

  ./install.sh DIRECTORY

All files are then installed below DIRECTORY.

You fine-tune installation directories by editing file "config".
