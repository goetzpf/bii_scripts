""" Module ListOfDict

This are functions to operate with the combined datatype list of dictionary items (dList).

* Functions to filter from a dList. Return the tuple of (match,notMatch) dictionaries

- filterMatch(dList,filterPar): test all items on its keys that are defined by the filter
    	    	    	    	parameter keys. Each value has to match at least one of the 
				filter parameter list.
  filterPar = {KEY:[VAL1,VAL2, ..], ..}
- filterRegExp(dList,mKey,mStr,flags=0): Test all items on one mKey, Value has to match
    	    	    	    	the mStr regulas expression.
- filterAllValuesRegExp(dList,mStr,flags=0): Test all values of all items on the mStr
    	    	    	    	regular expression. Filter only those items that match in at 
				least one value.
- filterValueRange(dList,mKey,fromPar,toPar) Test all items for the value of 'key' to be 
    	    	    	    	in range of 'value' >= 'fromPar', 'value' <='toPar'.

* Functions operating on the all occuring keys of the whole listOfDict

- getAllKeys(dList):            List of all occuring keys in the dList
- filterKeys(dList,keyList)     Filter dictionaries that have all keys from keyList
- filterOutKeys(dList,keyList)  Filter dictionaries that have all keys from keyList.
                                Delete  all not matching keys
- findKeysMatchingRegExp(dList,mStr): List of all occuring keys that match 'mStr'. The
                                values ar of no concern here.
- sort(dList,order=None):       sort by keys and values in lexical order.Optional parameter 
                                order is a list of keys to be respected in the given order.
    	    	    	    	Other keys are ignored. The items are returned unchanged

Functions to translate the dList to a table. Not occuring keys are represented
to None.

- orderToTable(dList,order): 	Extract and sort all 'order' keys, Ignore others.
- sortToTable(dList): 	    	sort by all keys, don't ignore any key.
