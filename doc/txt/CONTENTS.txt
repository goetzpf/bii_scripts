**cvs-recover.py**
  | A backup and recovery tool for CVS. 
  | Instead of saving the complete repository this script only saves
    differences relative to a central CVS repository. By this, much disk space
    is saved, the backup file has usually only about 100kBytes or less.  This
    can be used to distribute a small recovery file together with the
    application. If it is needed, it is possible to restore the state of the
    original CVS working copy from which the application was built.

    as a light-weight replacement for darcs-monitor.
  | `documentation <scripts/darcs-notify.html>`__

**darcs-restore**
  | see darcs-save

**darcs-save**
  | darcs-save and darcs-restore can be used to save and later restore a source
    tree that is under darcs control. The idea is to call darcs-save immediately
    before (binary) distribution. The generated directory named '.darcs-restore'
    should then be distributed, too.
    
  | In order to restore the sources for such a distribution, call darcs-restore
    with the distribution directory (which may be a remote path, darcs-restore
    uses scp) as first, and the name of the directory to be created as second
    argument. Special feature: it is not necessary to record pending changes
    prior to distribution.  Not-recorded changes and not-yet-added files and
    directories are restored just fine.

**darcs-sig**
  | create a textual representation of the state of a darcs repository (a list
    of log messages and some extra information).

**dbcount**
  | count the number of records in a file
  | `documentation <scripts/dbcount.html>`__

  | `documentation <scripts/dbdiff.html>`__

.. _dbfilter.pl:

**dbfilter.pl**
  | A tool to filter db files or to find information in db files. Regular
    expression matches can be done on record names, record types or values of
    record-fields.  Connections between records can be shown, lowCAL and SDO CAN
    links can be decoded.
  | The script needs the following perl modules:
  | `parse_db.pm`_ 
  | `analyse_db.pm`_ 
  | `canlink.pm`_ 
  | Here is the documentation and the source of the script itself:
  | `documentation <scripts/dbfilter.html>`__

**db_request.py**
  | a tool to perform SQL requests on the oracle database.
  | `documentation <scripts/db_request.html>`__

**dbscan.pl**
  | This script is from Rolf Keitel <rolf@triumf.ca>. It scans db and sch files
    and has lots of options, the most interesting being '-d' which searches for
    'dangling links'. I.e. it lists all records which have links that point
    somewhere outside the given db file (along with the target record).
    Unfortunately does not tell which link field and which target field.  Note
    that `dbfilter.pl`_ can do the same with it's "--unresolved_links" option.
  | `documentation <scripts/dbscan.html>`__

**dbsort**
  | print an EPICS database sorted. Note that `dbfilter.pl`_ does exactly the same
    when called with a database file and no options at all.

**dumpdb**
  | dump a database (\*.db) file, one record-name combined with one field name
    in a single line.

**expander.pl**
  | macro expander for text-files. Since this tool allows the execution of
    arbitrary perl-expressions, it is quite powerful and (if you want this) a
    programming language of its own. It features if-statements, complex
    expressions and for-loops among others.  This script needs the
    `expander.pm`_ module. See the `expander documentation <modules/expander.html>`__
    for a more comprehensive description of the expander file format.
  | `documentation <scripts/expander.html>`__

**filter_can_links.pl**
  | extract CAN links from a .db file (for the BESSY lowCAL protocol). Note that
    `dbfilter.pl`_ can do the same with it's "--lowcal" option.
  | `documentation <scripts/filter_can_links.html>`__

**flatdb**
  | expands and vdctdb db-file into a "flat" db file. 

**gadgetbrowser**
  | database browser for the new gadget database.

**git-meld**
  | compares all files of two git versions with meld.

**grab_xkeys.pl**
  | a little X11 utility that displays scan codes of pressed keys.

  | A tool to search in EPICS-db files. It allows to define regular expressions
    as triggers in its commandline options for record-name, record-type,
    field-name and field value if a record or a field matches the trigger, it
    causes a print of the record. To control the printed output there are
    options to define the record names, record types or field types that have to
    be printed. This script needs the `parse_db.pm`_ module.
  | `documentation <scripts/grepDb.html>`__

**hg2darcs.py**
  | A program that converts mercurial revisions to darcs revisions.
  | The changes, log messages and "author information remain intact, only the
    record date is set to today. Note that a darcs repository must already be
    present.
  | `documentation <scripts/hg2darcs.html>`__

**hg2git.py**
  | A program that converts mercurial revisions to git revisions. 
  | The changes, log messages and "author information remain intact, only the
    record date is set to today. Note that a git repository must already be
    present.
  | `documentation <scripts/hg2git.html>`__

**hg-kompare.py**
  | A program that calls kompare to do comparisions of the
    working copy with a mercurial repository or compare files of different 
    versions in the mercurial repository.
  | `documentation <scripts/hg-kompare.html>`__

**hg-recover.py**
  | A backup and recovery tool for mercurial. 
  | Instead of saving the complete repository this script only saves differences
    relative to a central mercurial repository. By this, much disk space is saved,
    the backup file has usually only about 100kBytes or less.
    This can be used together with rsync-dist.pl to distribute a small recovery
    file together with the application. If it is needed, it is possible to restore
    the state of the original working copy and mercurial repository from which the
    application was built. 
  | `documentation <scripts/hg-recover.html>`__

**idcp-dist-info**
  | A small wrapper script that calls rsync-dist-info.py for IDCP (undulator
    control) IOCs

    as it is installed on one of the BESSY undulators.
  | `documentation <scripts/idcp-restore>`__

**idcp-mls-restore**

**Sch2db.pl**
