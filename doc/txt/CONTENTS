----------------------------------------------------------------------
*Scripts*:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
*accLaunch*:
	launch panels for the BESSY II control system. All
	panels are read-only, so you can not interfere with 
	the control system.

*addPVtoArchiver*:
	script to add a PV to the channel access archiver.

*adl_cvs_diff.pl*:
	show differences between the working and the repository
	version of an dm2k panel (*.adl) file. Supports CVS and
	subversion as version control systems.

*adlsort.pl*:
	Print dm2k panel (*.adl) files sorted to standard out.
	This can be used to compare two dm2k panel files.

*bdns_import.pl*:
	import BESSY device names into the oracle database

*bdns_lookup.pl*:
	lookup BESSY device names in the oracle database

*browsedb.pl*:
	a perl-script with a graphical user interface to 
        browse the oracle database. The program can be used to view 
	and change data in the database as well as show relations 
	between the tables.

*buds_lookup.pl*:
	lookup BESSY units in the oracle database.

*camonitor_sort.pl*:
	sort and filer files created by the EPICS camonitor command.
	The filtering can be specified with regular expressions.
	This tool is especially useful when many different PV's 
	are monitored at a time.

*canlink.pl*:
	encode and decode the lowCAL hardware link as it is 
	used in the BESSY MultiCAN device support for EPICS.

*cvs_diff.pl*:
	compare versions of a file in a CVS repository. This tool
	can remove emtpy lines and c-comments before comparing.

*cvsGuru*:
	CVS wrapper script - for ctlguru only

*cvs_log_diff.pl*:
	compares the all log-messages between two revisions or tags
	in a CVS repository.

*dbcount*:
	count the number of records in a file

*dbdiff*:
	display the difference between two *.db files using tkdiff

*dbfilter.pl*:
	A tool to filter db files or to find information in db 
	files. Regular expression matches can be done on 
	record names, record types or values of record-fields.
	Connections between records can be shown, lowCAL and
	SDO CAN links can be decoded.

*dbscan.pl*:
	This script is from Rolf Keitel <rolf@triumf.ca>. It scans
	db and sch files and has lots of options, the most interesting
        being '-d' which searches for 'dangling links'. I.e. it lists
        all records which have links that point somewhere outside the
        given db file (along with the target record). Unfortunately
        does not tell which link field and which target field.
	Note that dbfilter.pl can do the same with it's "--unresolved_links" 
	option.

*dbsort*:
	print an EPICS database sorted. Note that dbfilter.pl does exactly
	the same when called with a database file and no options at all.

*dbutil.p*:
	A tool that can export oracle database-tables to ASCII files and 
	re-import these files. Useful if you want to change many parts
	of a database-table with your favorite text-editor...

*dumpdb*:
	dump a database (*.db) file, one record-name combined with one
	field name in a single line.

*expander.pl*:
	macro expander for text-files. Since this tool allows
	the execution of arbitrary perl-expressions, it is 
	quite powerful and (if you want this) a programming
	language of its own. It features 
	if-statements, complex expressions and for-loops among others.
	This script is a simple application of the expander.pm module.

*filter_can_links.pl*:
	extract CAN links from a .db file (for the 
	BESSY lowCAL protocol). Note that dbfilter.pl can
	do the same with it's "--lowcal" option.

*flatdb*:
	expands and vdctdb db-file into a "flat" db file. 

*gadgetbrowser*:
	database browser for the new gadget database.

*grab_xkeys.pl*:
	a little X11 utility that displays scan codes of pressed keys.

*grepDb.pl*:
       A tool to search in EPICS-db files. It allows to define regular
       expressions as triggers in its commandline options for record-name, 
       record-type, field-name and field value if a record or a field matches 
       the trigger, it causes a print of the record. To control the printed 
       output there are options to define the record names, record types or 
       field types that have to be printed.

*hgen.pl*:
	a header-generator for c and c++

*lockGuru*:
	Check and/or create the mutex file lock, probably used together
	with cvsGuru.

*makeDocPerl.pl*:
	create html documentation for perl scripts that contain
	embedded documentation according to "makeDoc" rules.

	create html documentation for ascii files that contain
	documentation according to "makeDoc" rules. 

*makeRegistrar*:
	create EPICS 3.14 registrar code (generates c-code).

*multi-commit.pl*:
	perform multiple commits (cvs|svn|darcs) with a prepared command-file.
	HTML documentation available!

*oracle_request*:
	command line tool to make database queries on the oracle database.

*paths2.pl*:
	like paths.pl but uses the global installation directories
	of the bii_scripts project.

*paths.pl*:
	prints commands to set your perl-environment in order to use
	the perl-modules and scripts of bii_scripts 

*pcomp.pl*:
	recursivly compare two directories. Shows which files or directories
	have different dates, different sizes or are missing. The files or 
	directories can be filtered. The kind comparisons can also be filtered.
	Can remove CVS tags or <CR> characters before comparing.

*pfind.pl*:
	a perl-script for powerful recursive file pattern search, like
	a recursive grep, but better. Features among other things
        text-file search, c-file search, regular expressions that 
	match across line-ends.

*rsync-deploy*:
	tool for management for distribution of binary files with.
	The successor of this script is rsync-dist.pl.

*rsync-dist.pl*:
	manages binary distributions to remote servers. No old version
	is ever lost. Uses hard-links to save storage space. Manages
	also symbolic links that point to the distribution directories
	on the server.
	HTML documentation available!

*Sch2db.pl*:
	a perl sch to db converter. Converts capfast(*.sch) files
	to the db file format as it is used in EPICS. This is faster
	and more flexible that the combination of sch2edif and e2db...

*sch_cvs_diff*:
	shows the difference between a modified capfast (*.sch) file
	and it's version on the top-trunk in the cvs repository.
	The difference of the resulting *.db files is shown, which
	is much clearer when you want to find out what was really 
	changed.

*set_ioc_tsrv.pl*:
	set terminal_server and optionally port to connect to 
	console of an ioc. Probably no longer needed since the
	conserver is now used for all IOCs.

*SetPerms*:
	a semi-automatic shell-script for setting file and 
	directory permissions in the CVS repository, in 
	epics, vxworks or development related directories.

*subst2exp.pl*:
	convert substitution-files to expander format for usage
	with the expander.pl script. This can be used on the fly
	as an alternative to EPICS msi, or to convert
	substitution files to expander format in order to use
	the much more powerful commands of the expander format
	when replacing values in EPICS template files. 

*substdiff*:
	compares two substitution files.

*substprint.pl*:
	pretty-print a substitution file

*tkSQL*:
	query the orcle database by directly entering SQL requests.
