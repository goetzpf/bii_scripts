Scripts:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SetPerms
	a semi-automatic shell-script for setting file and 
	directory permissions in the CVS repository, in 
	epics, vxworks or development related directories.

browsedb.pl
	a perl-script with a graphical user interface to 
        browse the oracle database. The program can be used to view 
	and change data in the database as well as show relations 
	between the tables.

pfind.pl
	a perl-script for recursive file pattern search, like
	a recursive grep, but better...

Sch2db.pl
	a perl sch to db converter. Converts capfast(*.sch) files
	to the db file format as it is used in EPICS. This is faster
	and more flexible that the combination of sch2edif and e2db...
	
dbscan.pl
	This script is from Rolf Keitel <rolf@triumf.ca>. It scans
	db and sch files and has lots of options, the most interesting
        being '-d' which searches for 'dangling links'. I.e. it lists
        all records which have links that point somewhere outside the
        given db file (along with the target record). Unfortunately
        does not tell which link field and which target field.
