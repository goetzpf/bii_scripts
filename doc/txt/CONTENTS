Scripts:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sch2db.pl
	a perl sch to db converter. Converts capfast(*.sch) files
	to the db file format as it is used in EPICS. This is faster
	and more flexible that the combination of sch2edif and e2db...

SetPerms
	a semi-automatic shell-script for setting file and 
	directory permissions in the CVS repository, in 
	epics, vxworks or development related directories.

browsedb.pl
	a perl-script with a graphical user interface to 
        browse the oracle database. The program can be used to view 
	and change data in the database as well as show relations 
	between the tables.

canlink.pl
	encode and decode the BESSY lowcal can-bus link as it is 
	used in the lowCAL device-support (EPICS)

dbscan.pl
	This script is from Rolf Keitel <rolf@triumf.ca>. It scans
	db and sch files and has lots of options, the most interesting
        being '-d' which searches for 'dangling links'. I.e. it lists
        all records which have links that point somewhere outside the
        given db file (along with the target record). Unfortunately
        does not tell which link field and which target field.

dbutil.p
	A tool that can export database-tables to ASCII files and 
	re-import these files. Useful if you want to change many parts
	of a database-table with your favorite text-editor...

expander.pl
	a script to perform macro-replacements in text files. Features
	if-statements, complex expressions and for-loops among others.
	This script is a simple application of the expander.pm module.


hgen.pl a header-generator for c and c++

paths.pl
	prints commands to set your perl-environment in order to use
	the perl-modules and scripts of bii_scripts 

pfind.pl
	a perl-script for recursive file pattern search, like
	a recursive grep, but better...
