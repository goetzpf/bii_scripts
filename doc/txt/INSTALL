This is the BESSY-scripts bundle.

after CVS checkout, you can do the following things to install
the scripts and modules:

perl Makefile.PL {options}
make
make install
make share

The following options may be useful:

* prefix=<directory>
  specify the directory where the files go
  
* SHARE_DIR=<directory>
  specify where the program configuration files go
  
* USE_PERL5LIB=<number>
  if you set number not to 0, then some scripts (currently
  browsedb.pl) will rely on the environment variable PERL5LIB
  in order to find their modules. Otherwise the modules will
  be searched at "$FindBin::RealBin/../lib/perl" where
  $FindBin::RealBin is the location of the perl-script
  
* USE_GP_MODULES=<number>
  if set to 1, libraries like Tk are taken from 
  /home/unix/pfeiffer/project/perl/lib/site_perl
  Note that this is for testing only and that it does only work
  on the BESSY 2 HP-UX systems
  

How to install on the BESSY HP-UX server ocean:

perl Makefile.PL prefix=/opt/csr/lib/perl \
USE_PERL5LIB=1 SHARE_DIR=/opt/csr/share
