bii_scripts: Use Perl Modules
*******************************

This file describes how to use the perl-modules in
this bundle in your own scripts. 

1) you have to ensure, that the bundle is set up correctly
   and that the documentation files are created. In order to do
   this, follow the steps described in the file "INSTALL", which
   is in the same directory as this file.

2) Note: The following steps probably work only with UNIX-like
operating systems. The perl-modules should also be usable with
windows, but you have to set-up of the environment variables
yourself in this case. 

2a)The easiest way to use the perl-modules, perl-scripts and
the man-pages of bii_scripts is by setting some environment
variables. In order to perform this task, there is a little
helper script in "bii_scripts/bin", "paths.pl".
"bii_scripts/bin/paths.pl" shows you the commands you have to
execute on the command line.
   
You can execute the commands on the fly with this command:
eval `bii_scripts/bin/paths.pl`
   
Note that the backticks (`) are not identical with the standard
single quote character (')!
   
Now the modules will be found by perl, the man-pages can be 
viewed directly by using "man", the scripts are in your
path-variable.
   
2b)  You can specify directly in your script, where to find the modules.
By this, your script run independently of the setting of
environment variables.

* Example: 

   when "bii_scripts" is in $HOME, add this to your script:
   
   use lib "$ENV{HOME}/bii_scripts/lib/perl"; 
   
You can see the embedded documentation of the modules directly, using
the "perldoc" utility, here is an example: 
   
   perldoc bii_scripts/lib/perl/dbitable.pm
